# Data Structure
Use Python to implement the selected questions from my textbook, Data Structure.

# About this repo
For now, offer 2 ways to implement the selected questions.
1. Directly use [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb), I will directly provide a link for that specific question.
2. For training purpose (myself), I will also provide (a) .py file(s) as answers to the selected question.
