# Data Structure
Use Python to implement the selected questions from my textbook, Data Structure.

# About this repo
* To implement the selected questions, I directly use [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb) as the working space.
* The selected questions can be found in each chapter's README.md. (See [Chapter01](https://github.com/Ratherman/DataStructure/tree/main/Chapter01) for example.)
